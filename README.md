This is a simple wrapper around the TMDB databse that allows you to search for movies, with full pagination. 

Please note that while the results from TMDB are apparently moderated by default, it does not appear to be that effective at removing adult themes. Unfortunately I realised this too late into development. I have found that "Shrek" is generally a safe bet. Sorry about that. The api also lacks result count limiting.
